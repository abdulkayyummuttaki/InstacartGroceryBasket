# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis


## Objective
You’re an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates
through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more
information about their sales patterns. Your task is to perform an initial data and exploratory
analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better
segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Context
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database
along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same
methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different
customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale
of their products. Your analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart
targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products. The stakeholders would like to
be able to answer the following key questions:

## Key Questions
              ● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day
              are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times
              when there are fewer orders.
              
              ● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend
              the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
              ● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use
              simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
              
              ● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
              and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product
              orders.
              
              ● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
              customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
              
                    ● What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
                    often do they return to Instacart)?
                    
                    ● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
                    
                    ● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
                    
                    ● Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?


## Skills

  • Python(pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn )
  • Jupyter anaconda
  • Data wrangling
  • Data merging
  • Deriving variables
  • Grouping data
  • Aggregating data
  • Reporting in Excel
  • Population flows


## Approach to the problem

  1. Understanding the data
  • Perform basic descriptive statistical operations with pandas to draw yearly insights into data.
  • Applying data wrangling on columns of the data source
  
  
  2. Data Cleaning
  • Finding and addressing mixed type variables in a dataframe.
  • Finding and addressing missing values in a dataframe.
  • Finding and addressing duplicate values in a dataframe.
  
  3.Data Preparation
  • Concatenating and merging data frames using join techniques.
  • Deriving new columns from existing datasets to answer business questions.
  • Using group and aggregate functions in pandas to answer complex business questions.
  
  
  4.Storytelling
  • Creating basic visualisations using Python libraries such as matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn .



## Conclusion
  1. The busiest days for the ad campaign are Saturdays and Sundays.
  2. Busy hours for the purchase orders are from 9 AM to 5 PM. During these hours, advertising/marketing is recommended.
  3. To increase sales order counts, the high-price range products require an additional ad campaign/marketing.
  4. Departments 4 and 16 have received the highest orders. The least purchase orders are received in the department 10,11,2, 21 and 8
  5. Detailed analysis and consolidated results of Python analysis in a [final report for stakeholders](https://github.com/abdulkayyummuttaki/InstacartGroceryBasket/blob/main/Storytelling.xlsx).
